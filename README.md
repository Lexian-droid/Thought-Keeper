## What is it?
This application is made to act as a virtual diary or Journal.
It helps you keep your thoughts in check!

It uses secure encryption for all entries you make. It has the ability
to add Images to each day as well. Every day has a respective timestamp,
and the time changes to reflect the current day every time you open the
app on a different day.

It will also auto-save, and can read aloud for you. It's like a sticky-
note, but on crack!
I hope you enjoy it, and if you have any ideas to improve it, let me know!

## Does this project have a Github?
Despite this application using a closed source engine, known as
"***Clickteam Fusion***" I still opted to release it's MFA and whatnot,
- only requirement is that you must include the LICENSE file.

We also accept forking, for example, if you want to add custom funactionlity, we completely accept that.

But we do not accept forks
that attempt to take the app away from the clickteam fusion platform, and
if you want to contribute, you must have the ability to modify MFA files.

Thanks!
